# GreenStyle

## Inspiration

Even prior to COVID-19, online shopping has become an unfortunate late-night habit for our team at GreenStyle. This has led to some questionable purchasesâ€¦ at some companies with  even more questionable practices when it comes to sustainable and ethical practices. COVID-19 has only unfortunately accelerated these late-night sessions and with all of us staying at home and constantly scrolling on TikTok and other social media, we have seen an increase in the promotion of affordable, low-quality fast fashion brands, which has only contributed to the significant issue of textile waste. We wanted to create a tool that would educate individuals about this issue while providing affordable alternatives to shopping online.
    
## About GreenStyle

GreenStyle is an online tool that allows users to input an image to an item of clothing they are interested in purchasing. Our tool identifies the item and brand, and checks if the brand has good ethical and sustainable practices. If they do not, GreenStyle suggests 3 alternative brands and more sustainable brands carrying items with similar price points, and style, along with their links so that users can find the item online and purchase it!
